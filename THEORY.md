# Universal Theory of Kinetic Harmonics (UTKH)

## Abstract

Building upon previous work and experimental data spanning from De Broglie, to Einstein, to modern day theories and experimental data, this article presents contributions within the framework of existing unified light-field theories. First, it hypothesizes that harmonic resonation is the fundamental cause of emergent properties and forces, supported by sonic wave experiments and observations of gravity and photon-mass interactions. Second, it presents a novel, unprecidented, and derivable geometric formula, which can serve as a foundational mathematical framework to predict future conditions of these potential photon co-orbital patterns. When subsequently applied to existing known priciples, applicable phenomena range in scale from the subquantum to the cosmic. Finally, it provides references observable recorded data as evidence that photons in subquantum orbital patterns are consistent with the known observable properties of quantum particles and behaviors.

## Introduction

The hypothesis that orbital light patterns is a universal property underpinning the universe is not new<sup>[1][2][3][4][16]</sup>. General Relativity's energy-mass equivalence has been observed well enough at this point to call it a law of nature<sup>[5][6]</sup>. Relationships between the hypothetical angular speed of light and Planck's Constant have been well established<sup>[7][8]</sup>, hinting at a possible connection that could unite GR with Quantum Mechanics. There are many indications that gravity is an emergent property<sup>[10][11]</sup>. The spacial geometry of the effects of sonic resonance align with the curvature of spacetime just due to the inverse-square law, and recent experimental observations have indicated a direct, itegral relationship between resonance and gravitational forces<sup>[9][12][13][14][15]</sup>. We know that light can used to directly sythensize massive particles<sup>[33][34]</sup>. Additionally, with the recent discovery of orbital light vortices<sup>[20][21][25]</sup> experimentations that have explored the photon-mass relationships between high-energy orbital vortex phenomena. This experimental data has opened up new avenues of proofs and speculations, such as light having angular momentum<sup>[24][23]</sup>, exhibiting harmonic properties<sup>[22][26][27][30][31][32]</sup>, effecting electric conductivity<sup>[28]</sup>, and even synthesizing particles of their own<sup>[35]</sup>.

To say that the implications and scope of this theory are vast may be an understatement. Applying the theory and proposed geometry functions in conjunction with Newtonian mechanics, the motion of linear and dynamic systems, waveform analysis, harmonic principles, and other well-established domains multiply into a number of combined potential applications far too numerous for a single publication. The goal is to present the concepts topologically, yet rigorously, while presenting the derived mathematical and physically observed evidential support. If correct, it has the potential for unique testable predictions to arise, new advancements in technology, and give new explanations to many long-standing questions our current frameworks leave unanswered.

The universal theory proposed in this paper begins with the assumption that all foundational properties of the universe arise from the transformation of the directional momentum of light into angular velocity, e.g. kinetic energy, into levels consistent with mass-energy equivalence. These systems (which I call kutonic systems, from their inherent kinetic nature) are described as stable patterns of orbital photons that exhibit and respond to resonant and harmonic frequencies from surrounding systems. The theory of these configurations is no more speculative than photon spheres, with the exception that it extends the theoretical configuration beyond black holes, and applies it at all scales of physical nature from the subquantum to cosmic.

While it may not necessarily assert that photons are a particle, it is useful for conceptual, mathematical, and geometric reasons to quantize these most basic states of the described systems (or a kuton) as a pair of photons in mutual co-orbit. It assumes that light's gravitational effects equal the energy of its moomentum, but even then such a hypothetical system is subquantum in scale. However, since this theory makes the assumption that resonant harmonics are what give rise to gravitational and other such forces, it is necessary to assume that photons exhibit a higher-dimensional oscillatory property so that such a condition can exist. This is echoed by the hyperdimensional simplicial set geometry used to derive the equations proposed. To state in a differen way, photons must exhibit a force of attraction to each other in order to be in a hypothetical state of co-orbit, and if we assume that the properties of resonance are the genesis of such forces based on GR-scale experiments, light must also have this property. That is in and of itself also not a novel idea, but by extending it to the relation between light and matter, it explains why we can observe partical-wave duality in quantum-level experiments in electron-positron pairs. While the hypothetical scale of kutonic systems are sub-quantum, the hypothetical energy levels are not, and in fact are confirmed by GR. Since UTKH views mass, gravity, and other forces as emergent phenomena, the assumed scale of this condition is not as important as much as its geometrical configurations of momentum and potential effects of those forces on nearby systems, as well as the aplification of the forces of these systems in ensemble resulting in cosmic-level forces that all fundamentally originate from subquantum events.

### Foundational Theories and Observations

Existing emergent theories suggest gravity to be an emergent property<sup>[36]</sup>. Experimental data has been published that confirms the relationship between mechanical motion and gravitional forces. The geometric mechanics of resonant fields follow the Gravitational Constant de to the inverse-square nature of it. Resonant patterns can be observed in nature scaling from quantum principles, electron orbital patterns and thus chemical reactions, to fluid dynamics, planetary systems, and even biological behaviors - all lending to the idea that this theory may very well be a universal law of nature.

Optical vortex systems, which have been studied at various scales, indicate that our understanding of photon mechanics leaves profound opportunities for further exploration. While researchers currently explain observational data to be particles in a "twisted state", the results could also be interpreted as harmonically driven via Runge-Kutta methods or unbound orbital dynamics, since the experiment setup's fundamentally conical nature may not accurately be synthesizing the bound state described by kutonics. If the theory presented is correct, it could be applied to allow researchers to produce more consistent results in future experiments. For example, if we can determine the resonant frequencies of an electron $w_e$ and a proton $w_p$, we could align the experimental setup in a harmonic ratio where as:

$$\sum_{n=0}^\infty W_\tau \cdot \frac{1}{2^n} = W_n = w_e \cdot w_p$$

hypothetically optimizing the conditions for particle synthesis, tuning the experimental input in order to **synthesize a hydrogen atom** as well as more complex particle configurations, or targeting specific atomic structures to trigger certain events previously untested.

Applying ***simplicial complexes***, specifically the spherical geometry of polyhedrons, serves as an intuitive stepping stone by aligning the theoretical mechanics of potential photonic orbital patterns (which I call a kuton or kutonic system) and then aligning the input patterns of the input orbital vortices or photon frequency to the observed harmonics of these particles. Determining the specific orbital dynamics of particles, elements, and molecules would open vast doors in the realms of technology and scientific advancement.

Currently, attempts to mathematically compute such a configuration range from hinge theories, to theses that do nothing more than explore the profound mathematical problem. Here, I demonstrate an effective and verifyable approach to that problem that has not yet been explored.

### Calculating Stable $N$-Vertex Polyhedron Configurations

Utilizing computer simulations, stable polyhedral vertex configurations were accomplished. This is not a new approach in and of itself, but these simulations followed the following algorithm:

 - $N$ points were introduced into a simulated 3-dimensional space.
 - Each point was applied in iterations with a concert of simulated forces:

   - All points were attracted to the center of the system.
   - All points repelled each other.
   - All points were constrained by a set proximity to the center of the system, as to result in a set of verices with a shared, consistent radius, and an even distribution along the surface of the polyhedral sphere.

After initialization and subsequent iterations of the algorithm, the system stabilized into configurations where each point settled on a spherical plane in a manner that was equidistent from its neighbors. Subsequently, the following pattern was observed:

 - For $N = 2$ the vertices are diametrically opposite, so $\cos\theta=-1$ and $\theta=\pi$ radians (thus forming a line passing throught he center of the sphere).
 - For $N = 3$ the vertices form an equilateral triangle on the bisectional equator, with $\cos\theta=-\frac{1}{2}$ and $\theta=\frac{2\pi}{3}$ radians, where the geometric center of the trinagle was the center of the sphere.
 - For $N = 4$ the vertices form a tetrahedron, with $\cos\theta=-\frac{1}{3}$ and $\cos\theta=\frac{\pi}{2}$

Generalizing this pattern, intuiviely the optimal angle of separation between adjacent points on a spherical polyhedron for any given $N\gt2$ is:
    
$$\cos\theta=-\frac{1}{N-1}\cdot$$

Intiutively, this relationship arises because for $N$ points distributed uniformly on the sphere:

 - The angular separation decreases as $N$ increases.
 - The denominator $N-1$ ensures that the total angular coverage of the sphere is preserved while accounting for the increasing number of adjacent points.

Taking the inverse cosine yields the angular separation:

  $$\theta=\arccos\left(-\frac{1}{N-1}\right)\cdot$$

### Alternate Symmetrical from Euler Derivative to Confirm Validity

Using Euler angles, the placement of points is parameterized by:
$$\begin{align*} \alpha_i &= \frac{2\pi i}{N}, \quad i = 0, 1, \dots, N-1, \\ \beta &= \arccos\left(1 - \frac{2}{N}\right). \end{align*}$$

**Relating $\theta$ and $\beta$**

The polar angle $\beta$ ensures uniform distribution in latitude based on the solid angle per point:
$$
\Omega = \int_0^\beta 2\pi \sin\theta \, d\theta = \frac{4\pi}{N},
$$
yielding:
$$
\beta = \arccos\left(1 - \frac{2}{N}\right).
$$

The pairwise cosine relationship for two points on a sphere, parameterized by $(\alpha, \beta)$, is:
$$
\cos \theta_{ij} = \cos\beta_1 \cos\beta_2 + \sin\beta_1 \sin\beta_2 \cos(\alpha_1 - \alpha_2).
$$

For uniform distributions:
1. The average $\cos\theta_{ij}$ reduces to $-\frac{1}{N-1}$, consistent with the original derivation.
2. The Euler-derived coordinates, using $\beta = \arccos(1 - 2/N)$, enforce this symmetry by ensuring equivalent angular separations in both latitude ($\beta$) and longitude ($\alpha$).

## **Higher-Dimensional Projection and Gravitational Analysis**

Knowing the optimum angle between each point on the polyhedral sphere and the center of the sphere is not enough in order to graph the Euclidean coordinates of each point. More derivation was necessary to explore. To do so, I imagined a circle that had all the points along it's edges distributed in a normalized pattern, and then imagined that circle travelling perpendicular into a plane. This results in a 3-dimensional "shadow", and as the points came in contact with the plane, they could be graphed onto a 3-dimensional sphere.

Unfortunately, this was not adequate enough for even, normal distribution. To accomplish this, I introduced a hypothetical 4th dimension for each point. Intuitively, from simplicial set geometry, we know that:

 - A point has a simplicial complex of zero.
 - A line has a simplicial complex of 1.
 - A plane has a simplicial complex of 2

And so on. By utilizing the previously derived forumula for optimal angular difference between vertices, graphing the points onto 4-dimensional space, projecting the points into 3-dimensional space, and then adding the following energy equation:

$$
E = \sum_{m \neq n} \left( \cos\theta_{mn} - \cos\theta_{\text{ideal}} \right)^2
$$

where:
  - $\cos\theta_{mn} = \mathbf{P}_m \cdot \mathbf{P}_n$, the cosine of the angular separation between points $P_m$ and $P_n$
  - $\cos\theta_{\text{ideal}} = -\frac{1}{N-1}$, the ideal cosine value for angular separation.

This function minimizes deviations from the ideal angular separation $\theta_{\text{ideal}}$, ensuring the most uniform distribution of $N$ points on the unit sphere. These simulations were performed with multiple values of $N$, including $2, 3, 4, 5$ as well as higher prime numbers such as $13, 17, 23, 83$ et cetera. All resulting graphs fit the desired criteria.

### **Deeper Dive: Angular Separation on the Sphere**

The foundation of this method lies in the angular separation between $N$ points distributed symmetrically on a sphere. The angular separation, $\theta$, as previously derived:

$$
\cos\theta = -\frac{1}{N-1}
$$

where:
- $N$ is the number of points,
- $\theta$ is the angular separation between adjacent points, assuming an ideal symmetric distribution.

This formula ensures that the points are distributed as uniformly as possible while maintaining geometric constraints. The derivation follows directly from the condition that the dot product of unit vectors between any two points satisfies

$$
\cos\theta = \mathbf{P}_1 \cdot \mathbf{P}_2
$$

By rearranging points to minimize deviations from $-\frac{1}{N-1}$, the points achieve an approximate optimal configuration.

### **Embedding in Higher Dimensions**

For $N > 3$, perfect symmetry requires embedding the points into a Hilbert space, so that the simplicial complex of the higher-dimensional qubit is that of a Bloch SIC-POVM regular tetrahedron.

$$
\mathbf{v}_k = 
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } k = \ell, \\
-\frac{1}{N-1} & \text{if } k \neq \ell
\end{cases}
$$

The vertices are normalized to ensure they lie on the unit $(N-1)$-dimensional sphere:

$$
\mathbf{v}_k = \frac{\mathbf{v}_k}{\|\mathbf{v}_k\|}
$$

After constructing the higher-dimensional simplex, the points are projected onto the 3D sphere. The projection is defined as taking the first three components of each vector:

$$
\mathbf{P}_k = \text{Proj}_{3D}(\mathbf{v}_k)
$$

Finally, the projected points are re-normalized to the unit sphere:

$$
\mathbf{P}_k = \frac{\mathbf{P}_k}{\|\mathbf{P}_k\|}
$$

This process maintains the symmetry of the distribution while reducing the dimensionality.

### **Gravitational Force Analysis**

To verify the stability and symmetry of the arrangement, the total gravitational force acting on each point is calculated. The gravitational force between two points $P_m$ and $P_n$ is given by:

$$
\mathbf{F}_{mn} = G \cdot \frac{m_m m_n}{r_{mn}^2} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{mn}
$$

where:
- $G$ is the gravitational constant (normalized to $1$),
- $m_m$ and $m_n$ are the masses of points (assumed equal, $m = 1$),
- $r_{mn} = \|\mathbf{P}_n - \mathbf{P}_m\|$ is the Euclidean distance between points $P_m$ and $P_n$,
- $\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{mn} = \frac{\mathbf{P}_n - \mathbf{P}_m}{\|\mathbf{P}_n - \mathbf{P}_m\|}$ is the unit vector pointing from $P_m$ to $P_n$.

The net gravitational force acting on point $P_m$ is then:

$$
\mathbf{F}_m = \sum_{n \neq m} \mathbf{F}_{mn}
$$

To ensure symmetry, the direction of the total gravitational force $\mathbf{F}_m$ is compared with the vector pointing toward the center of the sphere:

$$
\hat{\mathbf{F}}_m = \frac{\mathbf{F}_m}{\|\mathbf{F}_m\|}
$$

Ideally, $\hat{\mathbf{F}}_m$ should align with the vector pointing to the origin, confirming that the system is gravitationally stable and symmetric. All tests with the polyhedral forumula pass this test, even in complex systems.

### **Energy Optimization for Point Distribution**

The final configuration of points minimizes the potential energy function, which penalizes deviations from the ideal angular separation:

$$
E = \sum_{m \neq n} \left( \cos\theta_{mn} - \cos\theta_{\text{ideal}} \right)^2
$$

where:
- $\cos\theta_{mn} = \mathbf{P}_m \cdot \mathbf{P}_n$ is the cosine of the angular separation between points $P_m$ and $P_n$,
- $\cos\theta_{\text{ideal}} = -\frac{1}{N-1}$.

This optimization ensures that the points achieve maximum angular separation while remaining on the unit sphere.

### Physical Implications of Stable Spherical Polyhedrons

It was interesting to note that while the formula produces evenly-distributed verticies along the spherical plane of polyhedrons, they did not always result in Platonic polyhedrons, even in cases where $N = 8$ where one might expect a perfect cube. However, the gravitational totals still equate to zero, meaning these structures don't have to be "perfect" to form. I see this as a promising sign that the conditions for these systems do not need to be so exact in order to form.
