  "description": "The **Universal Theory of Kinetic Harmonics** (UTKH) posits that mass and fundamental forces arise from co-orbital light patterns exhibiting resonance and harmonics. By redefining mass as a specific state of light, UTKH aims to unify physical phenomena across scales, providing explanations for gravity, atomic structures, nuclear forces, and chemical bonds within a single framework. This theory addresses gaps in current models and offers testable predictions that could reshape our understanding of the universe.",
