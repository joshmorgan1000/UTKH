# Kinetic Harmonics: A Universal Theory of Motion and Resonance <a href="#top"></a>

You can find this hosted [here](http://sonicpoets.com/).

The **Universal Theory of Kinetic Harmonics (UTKH)** is a unified field theory of physics that ties all phenomena of the known universe into a single framework. Its principles connect with and expand upon several established ideas in classical and modern physics, bridging the gap between general relativity, quantum mechanics, and other emergent theories. It fundamendally both redefines and aligns with current models, providing new insights and reshaping our understanding of the universe.
