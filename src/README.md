## If You Want to Build and Host

It would be cool if you did, shoot me a line if you do! I'd be interested to hear about it.

Requirements: npm, node

```
npm install
npm run build
```

Simply copy the index.html, bundle.js, and background.jpg to your web directory.

Alternatively, you can just run:

```
npx serve dist
```

And view the "magic" locally.

Eventually computer simulations will be built in to the code.

If you would like to fork/contribute, you can run:
```
python3 toc_generate
```
from this `src` directory in order to re-generate the table of contents in the README.md file.
